# control-rate-for-canvas

Today is 1024, so maybe I can do something to celebrate this special day for me(maybe a designer or programer)
At the same time, I find view the record of class is difficult, some content densities are low and the official control rate max is 2x. So, I want to develop an easy tool for this scene.

*Although I don't watch the recording much, someone needs it.*
