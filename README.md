# control-rate-for-canvas

## At the beginning

Today is 1024, so maybe I can do something to celebrate this special day for me(maybe a designer or programer)
At the same time, I find view the record of class is difficult, some content densities are low and the official control rate max is 2x. So, I want to develop an easy tool for this scene.

## Function Description

* free control of playback rate by user's input, even if it is the variable of double
* use the keyboard(left and right arrow) to control current time

## Install Description

After install this extension, maybe need to refresh the web page to load.  

By a way, I will publish it in the edge, and it is a pity that I can't register to be a chrome developer. If you prefer Chrome, you can only install it yourself, sorry.
Code can be download in the [releases](https://github.com/wujinhjun/control-rate-for-canvas/releases).

## At the end

*Although I don't watch the recording much, someone needs it.*

*Sorry, some classmates told me that this user interface is so ugly that they can't believe it was made by an designer. So, I will redesign this ui and at the same time I will commit it as one homework.*
